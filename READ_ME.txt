This case study was about identifying the leads that could help X Education in getting the lead 
conversion rate increase from 30% to about 80% i.e. getting more people join their courses.
To get to the result, we used Multivariate Logistic Regression to build our model initially and get to the 
result. Later, PCA was used to identify the principal components and the accuracy of the model built. 
Starting the model building in a conventional manner, basic steps for importing the data, cleaning it, 
identifying the outliers were done. We had removed some redundant columns and deleted the missing 
values as there was no other logical way to import the missing data as the data set was completely user 
based.
